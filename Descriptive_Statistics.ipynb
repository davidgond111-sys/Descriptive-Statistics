        "### What insights can these measures provide about the player’s scoring performance?\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Mean (`19.63 points`):** This indicates the player's average scoring ability. On a typical game, the player can be expected to score around 20 points.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Median (`19.5 points`):** Being very close to the mean, the median confirms that the data is fairly symmetrical and not heavily skewed by unusually high or low scores. This reinforces the idea that 19-20 points is a good representation of their central performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Mode (No unique mode):** The absence of a unique mode suggests that the player does not consistently hit a single score more often than others. Their scoring varies across games rather than clustering around one specific number.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Range (`10 points`):** This tells us the total spread of the player's scores, from their lowest (15) to their highest (25). A range of 10 points indicates some variability in their performance, but it's not extremely wide, suggesting they generally perform within a reasonable band.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Standard Deviation (`3.15 points`):** This is a key measure of consistency. A relatively low standard deviation of `3.15` points (compared to the mean) indicates that the player's scores are generally close to their average. They are quite consistent in their scoring, meaning their performance doesn't fluctuate drastically from game to game. Most of their scores fall within about 3 points of their 19.63-point average.\n",
        "\n",
        "**In summary:** The player is a **consistent scorer**, averaging nearly 20 points per game, with most scores falling close to this average. While they have a range of 10 points between their best and worst games, the low standard deviation highlights their reliability in scoring within a predictable band."
